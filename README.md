## Prerequisites

## Approach
* First need to clone this respiratory
* User scans Telegram login QR code to log in into the Telegram Desktop application.
* Run python script script.py using py script.py in the terminal
* The script reads a customized message from an excel sheet.
* The script reads rows one by one and searches that username in the Telegram Desktop Application search box if the username found on Telegram then it will send a configured message otherwise It reads next row. 
* Loop executes until and unless all rows complete.

Note: If you wish to send an image or documents instead of text you can write code to add attachment send functionality.
